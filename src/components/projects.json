This is very much a work in progress, and we do have a single module at the minimum viable product state, that being the schedule grid, with more to come soon. The grid can be directly included in a conventionâ€™s website with scripts or included as an iframe. A sample of the iframe can be found at the link below.",

    "description": "Since 2020, I have been maintaining and re-theming the Vanhoover Pony Expo site for each year's event. I have iterated over a couple of technology stacks in that time, starting with Joomla!, moving to WordPress, and now an upcoming migration to Hugo. During this time, I have also created a WordPress theme from scratch and multiple plugins to add functionality to the site. One such enhancement is a custom widget to read and pull sponsor tier memberships from Convention Master (directly from the self-hosted DB since it does not have its own API at time of writing) and display them on the website as a thank you message.",

Like with Vanhoover, I have done a lot of customization to meet requirements; including the Convention Master integration along with custom WooCommerce functionality, which was essential for running a virtual year during the pandemic.",
